### Exercise: FastAPI vs Django

#### What is FastAPI?

![FastAPI](../assets/exercises_assets/fast_api.png)

FastAPI is a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+. It is based on the ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) standard, allowing it to handle concurrent requests with async/await syntax. It is designed to be easy to use and learn, with features like intuitive syntax, automatic data validation and serialization, interactive documentation, and extensive testing tools.

**Main Features:**

- **Fast**: One of the fastest web frameworks available, handling over 21,000 requests per second.
- **API-centric**: Supports various data formats and follows the OpenAPI specification.
- **Type-safe**: Uses Python type annotations for defining API parameters.
- **Scalable**: Built on the ASGI standard for asynchronous and concurrent request handling.
- **Secure**: Provides authentication, authorization, encryption, and CORS support.
- **Efficient Documentation**: Offers interactive, intuitive documentation with great editor support.

**Shortcomings:**

- Limited Built-In Security
- Limited Built-In Functionalities
- Learning Curve for Asynchronous Programming

#### What is Django?

Django is a mature, full-stack web framework for building web applications with Python. It follows the MVT (Model-View-Template) pattern, separating the logic, presentation, and data layers of the application. Known for its batteries-included philosophy, Django provides many features and functionalities out of the box.

**Main Features:**

- **Versatile**: Suitable for a wide range of web projects.
- **Productive**: Tools and shortcuts for common tasks and a powerful admin interface.
- **Reliable**: Stable and proven, with a strong community and abundant resources.
- **Secure**: Provides mechanisms to prevent common web attacks and includes a user authentication system.

**Django Architecture:**
