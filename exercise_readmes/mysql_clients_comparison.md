# MySQL Client Libraries for Python

When working with MySQL databases in Python, several libraries are available to connect and interact with the database. Below is a comparison of the main libraries used for this purpose:

## **MySQL-python (MySQLdb)**

**MySQLdb** provides a Python interface to MySQL. It uses the MySQL C API library, allowing Python programs to connect to MySQL databases using C extensions. While known for its performance, it is no longer actively maintained and has largely been replaced by `mysqlclient`.

## **mysqlclient**

**mysqlclient** is a fork of MySQLdb and is actively maintained. It provides the same DB-API interface and is designed to work with Python 3. It is currently one of the fastest MySQL connectors for CPython and requires the `mysql-connector-c` C library.

Key factors contributing to MySQLClient's speed:
1. **C Extension**: Uses a C extension module (`_mysql`) for direct interaction with the MySQL C API.
2. **Efficient Memory Management**: Offers fine-tuned memory management.
3. **Native API Access**: Optimizes data transfer and query execution.
4. **Low-Level Optimization**: Optimizes low-level operations, such as socket communication and data serialization.

## **mysql-connector-python**

**mysql-connector-python** is the official MySQL driver developed by Oracle. It supports both Python 2 and Python 3 and provides a pure Python interface to MySQL databases. It includes features like connection pooling, support for MySQL 8.0, and compliance with the DB-API specification. However, its performance is generally slower compared to other libraries.

## **PyMySQL**

**PyMySQL** is a pure Python MySQL client library. It is actively maintained and provides a DB-API compliant interface without requiring external C libraries, making it easier to install and use in various environments.

### **When to use PyMySQL**

- If you cannot use `libmysqlclient`.
- If you want to use monkeypatched socket of `gevent` or `eventlet`.
- If you need to hack the MySQL protocol.

## **Django Note**

Django's ORM can be used with either the MySQLdb/mysqlclient/PyMySQL API or the "MySQL Connector/Python" API.
